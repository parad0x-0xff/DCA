# Docker Code Analysis

For a long time I'm facing a problem when doing code review and everytime I wanted to debug
an appllication, was a pain in the ass. So I decided to create DCA.

The mais difference is each Dockerfile is configured to connect remotly on VSCode.
So I doon't have to worry about debugging any more.
